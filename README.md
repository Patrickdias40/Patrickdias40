# Hi, I'm Patrick! :)
####  These are my first steps on github, until early 2023 I will only use this account for studies related to CTISM, the school I am currently at (2021 - Veteran).

**Making this page is my first job, but without knowing what to do I will try to do something.**

Currently, I'm studying at CTISM where I'm in the second year of high school integrated in computer technician (2020). Finishing up at the end of next year, I don't know what I'm going to follow as a profession but I have in mind to follow in the field of information or more specific Marketing on social networks.

So far I've learned some things like HTML, Javascript, the basics of programming and a little bit more, I don't think anything very deep, so I'm not sure if I'll continue in this area.

I love sports, even if I don't practice as I should at the moment. The ones I like the most are **montun bike**, **rafting**, **motocros**, **rappelling**, all of which involve nobility. As much as I still don't practice all of them, I know I'll go regardless of what I'm going to work with. I like electronic sports too, preferring battle royale.
